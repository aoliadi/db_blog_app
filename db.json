We had to capture the experience of everyone in the village realizing what was going to happen. It was shot brilliantly as well. You have these ominous close-ups of Vader with the strength of his body and pure determination, then you cut to Obi-Wan and he’s scared, confused, and feels the darkness of Vader’s presence.”</p>\n<p>Responsible for arranging the many layers of sound effects, dialogue, and music in sync with the picture, Dupre explains how she “could not wait to bring silence into the scene, because that’s an opportunity to make the audience fearful and anxious. When you take everything away, you’re left with that terrifying image in front of you, and you feel the weight of the moment. Natalie Ann Holt, the composer, is an incredible talent and our job was to balance that driving momentum of Vader and the musical score with those quiet, tense moments with Obi-Wan. Once the action commences with the fight, we can really take it to town with loud, painful sounds. It was a lot of work, but it was really fun.”</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-187132-1\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Lightsaber-start-clashes.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Lightsaber-start-clashes.mp3\">https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Lightsaber-start-clashes.mp3</a></audio>\n<h6 style=\"font-size: small; color: #4e4e4e;\">Above: Lightsaber effects from <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></h6>\n<p>Growing up as the daughter of a professional musician, Dupre often accompanied her father to performances where handling audio equipment became second nature. “I was a pretty quiet kid,” she explains, “so I did a lot of just sitting there and taking everything in. Even as a kid, the main impression I remember about experiencing things was how it sounded.” She admits that a love for <em>Star Wars </em>was not part of her childhood, but rather the pure interest in sound and storytelling.</p>\n<p>“I grew up playing music,” Dupre continues, “and I got a great job in the field after graduating from the University of Southern California. But I had some decisions I needed to make about what I wanted and where I wanted to be located. Film was not something I set out to be involved in, but it was always something I was interested in.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187132]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187198\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Dupre working in the sound studio\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design-150x100.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design-300x200.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design-768x512.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/danielle-dupre-sound-design-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Though Dupre admittedly fell into working in cinema, the discovery of the art form when she was hired at Skywalker Sound was a sort of epiphany. “My main goal besides working in sound was to tell stories,” she explains. “I’d only thought about it in the music context, but the opportunity to do so in film was a whole new playing field. Aside from just having more speakers, which is always fun, you have music, dialogue, effects &#8212; all these storytelling tools at your disposal.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-187200 size-full\" style=\"max-width: 40%;\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/john-borland-headshot-1.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Borland\" width=\"737\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/john-borland-headshot-1.jpg 737w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/john-borland-headshot-1-111x150.jpg 111w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/john-borland-headshot-1-221x300.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" /></span></p>\n<p>Dupre’s colleague, sound designer and editor Jon Borland, is among those Skywalker Sound artists who did grow up with the galaxy far, away. As Dupre recalls, “Jon told me once that ‘There are some people who have the rhythm of Darth Vader’s breathing etched into their soul, like me!’” Borland initially studied graphic design and worked in multimedia. He later chose to follow his passion for film sound and attended the Vancouver Film School where Skywalker Sound’s head of sound design Randy Thom was a frequent visitor. He later recruited Borland into the company, as well as supervising sound editors Nia Hansen and Jeremy Bowker.</p>\n<p>Borland quips that “in what would probably be considered my misspent youth, I watched <em>Star Wars</em> over and over again, so you probably don’t need to tell me where different sounds go.” He reveled in the opportunity to explore the franchise’s sound library first established by sound designer Ben Burtt on <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>. “The effects in the library were named whatever Ben had called them at the time,” says Borland. “It wasn’t called ‘<a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/millennium-falcon\"><em>Millennium Falcon</em></a>,’ but rather ‘pirate ship.’ ‘Lightsabers’ were ‘laser swords.’ Everything had this deep lineage.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187132]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187292\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100.jpg\" alt=\"The Millennium Falcon\" width=\"1280\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100-150x63.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100-300x127.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100-768x324.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ships-of-the-galaxy-the-millennium-falcon-e4d-ia-100-1024x432.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-187132-2\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ep4-SFX-pirate-ship-Flight-sequence_01.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ep4-SFX-pirate-ship-Flight-sequence_01.mp3\">https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ep4-SFX-pirate-ship-Flight-sequence_01.mp3</a></audio>\n<h6 style=\"font-size: small; color: #4e4e4e;\">Above: &#8220;Pirate ship&#8221; effects from <em>A New Hope</em></h6>\n<p>As Master <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/yoda\">Yoda</a> might say, “Already know you that which you need.” The sonic “aesthetic” of <em>Star Wars</em>, as Borland puts it, “comes intuitively once you understand the nuts and bolts of what Ben did. They’re all natural, believable, <em>real </em>sounds. It’s not like you just go to a synthesizer and dial a bunch of nobs to make a <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/tie-fighter\">TIE fighter</a>. That’s an elephant roaring. <em>Star Wars</em> sound design is about finding the right sounds and using them or combining them in unorthodox ways as opposed to creating something out of thin air.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187132]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-161939\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Burtt behind-the-scenes of The Empire Strikes Back\" width=\"1280\" height=\"866\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design-150x101.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design-300x203.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design-768x520.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ben-burtt-at-at-sound-design-173x117.jpg 173w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The legacy of <em>Star Wars </em>sound design is not only evident in the recordings themselves, but in their original creators who still work at the company, like sound designer Gary Rydstrom, Randy Thom, or Ben Burtt himself. “We have all of these people just walking down the hall,” Dupre comments. “They each have many Academy Awards and they’re all so humble. It’s a relatively small place and we’re all here for the same reason.” Rydstrom even generously took a moment to listen in with Dupre as she worked on the opening to <em>Kenobi</em>’s Part III.</p>\n<p>Dupre had her first opportunity to work on <em>Star Wars </em>as a mixer on projects like <em>Star Wars Resistance</em>, <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>(“The Duel”) while Borland, who initially trained as a foley recordist, worked on an episode of <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </em>before sound editing on <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi </em>and <em>The Mandalorian</em>, among others. Both, along with their fellow crew members, have spent recent years adjusting to the workload and pace of episodic series. “We’ve slowly and surely figured out a system of ‘How do you pull off a six-hour movie in three months?’” as Borland says.</p>\n<p>Together with their fellow Skywalker Sound crew members, Dupre and Borland worked under the supervision of series director Deborah Chow, who Borland describes as “very proactive with the sound.” Chow “wasn’t caught up with <em>how</em> something would sound,” he continues, “but was focused on the character and the emotion. She knew what she wanted each character to be, and that was very helpful. It empowers you to bring your own skillset to the table. She communicates clearly how she wants it to feel, which is great because we don’t necessarily have a vocabulary for sound. When NED-B dies, she wanted the sounds to feel sad.” (Borland also adds that the sounds for NED-B’s movements originated from a bread maker, similar to the seat and antenna motors used for <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/c-3po\">C-3PO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/r2-d2\">R2-D2</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187132]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187411\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb.jpg\" alt=\"NED-B aiming blaster\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb-150x100.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-nedb-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-187132-3\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Ned-B-movements.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Ned-B-movements.mp3\">https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-Ned-B-movements.mp3</a></audio>\n<h6 style=\"font-size: small; color: #4e4e4e;\">Above: NED-B servo movement effects from <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></h6>\n<p>During their earliest work on the series, Chow consulted with Borland about the concept for Princess Leia’s companion droid, L0-LA59, known as Lola. “She didn’t even pitch the entire show to me,” he says, “but just said, ‘There’s a little girl and she’s going to have this droid that’s like a toy or companion. This would be the baby version of R2-D2.’”</p>\n<p>The final sound for Lola included fragments of Borland’s own voice as well as his five-year-old daughter’s. “I’ve manipulated it to make it sound like beeps and boops,” he says with pride. “That’s my daughter saying ‘May the Force be with you,’ but I’ve changed it so you can’t tell. The inspiration was Ben Burtt who used his own voice for R2-D2. The brilliance of Artoo is that he has a whole pallet of different sounds that don’t all sound alike, but when you put them together it’s Artoo.” As Borland attests, the heavy precedent of Burtt’s success makes creating new droid sounds one of the biggest challenges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187132]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-186745\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola.jpg\" alt=\"LOLA\" width=\"1280\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola-150x63.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola-300x126.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola-768x322.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obi-wan-kenobi-still-lola-1024x429.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Time and again, the sense of legacy at Skywalker Sound is palpable, both in the sound effects themselves and in the generations of artists who’ve created them. “Skywalker is just a great environment for learning and growing,” notes Borland, and Dupre adds that “you learn so much on every single project you work on.” For us listening in the audience, each new story in the galaxy far, far away is instantly familiar with the first few decibels of a ship’s engines, a blaster’s charge, or a creature’s roar.</p>\n<p>Dupre and Borland’s Skywalker Sound colleagues on <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> were supervising sound editors Matthew Wood and Trey Turner, re-recording mixers Scott Lewis and Bonnie Wild, sound effects editors Michael Levine, Kevin Bolen, and Tim Farrell, sound editor and re-recording mixer David Collins, foley editor Thom Brennan, ADR/dialogue editors Ryan Cota and Angela Ang, and foley artists Ronni Brown, Margie O’Malley, Sean England, and Andrea Gard. “We try to make it as collaborative as possible even though one mixer takes the lead on a specific episode,” notes Dupre. “They all play together as a cohesive story. There isn’t competition when it comes to the work. It’s a collaboration; it’s people dedicated to telling the best story possible and being true to the art form. It’s a dream to work with these people on a daily basis.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div><div class=\"dplus-promo-container\"><a class=\"dplus-promo-image-anchor\" href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle?cid=DTCI-Synergy-StarWars-Blog-Acquisition-Bundle-US-Bundle-DisneyPlus-EN-BlogWidget-StarWars_BlogWidget_GetTheDisneyBundle-NA\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"1001\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disneyplus-bundle-lockup-1000x215.png\" class=\"attachment-disney-plus-promo size-disney-plus-promo\" alt=\"Hulu.

Seth Simpkins, 18, took his first steps in the field at a young age.</p>\n<p>“My <em>FIRST</em> journey started 10 years ago as part of a <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>FIRST</em>® LEGO® League team</a>,” Seth recalls. “It was the starting point of understanding that, as a child, I could problem solve.”</p>\n<p>Seth and his team, the Lunatecs, took that problem-solving mindset and applied it to a need they discovered in their local community.</p>\n<p>“The Lunatecs’ first project was designing and engineering a volleyball launcher for a man with quadriplegia who wanted to launch a ball into play,” Seth says. “Once we realized we could impact how physically challenged individuals live, work, and play by using the skills we learned in <em>FIRST</em>, we knew implementing this program was a win for all.”</p>\n<p>The team continued its work on adaptive devices, eventually focusing on a swim fin to assist veteran amputees and spinal cord injury victims under the guidance of their mentor Mike Marandola. Originally modeled with CAD software and created by hand, the team has since refined the process for 3-D printing to speed up fabrication and adapted the swim fin for use in pediatrics. “These will be used widely by therapists providing aqua therapy to help patients increase muscle strength and mobility,” says Seth.</p>\n<p>Seth credits <em>Star Wars</em>, in particular <em>Star Wars: </em><a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker\"><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a><em>,</em> for reminding him that one person can make a big difference. “It inspires me to believe that with the right tools our generation can advance and make a difference now,” he says.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186773]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187303\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon.jpg\" alt=\"The Exploding Bacon team from Star Wars: Force for Change and FIRST's Build the Future.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon-150x113.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon-300x225.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon-768x576.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-exploding-bacon-1088x816.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Exploding Bacon</strong></p>\n<p>Eighteen-year-old Lexi Udowychenko of Exploding Bacon also found inspiration in the galaxy far, far away.

The social media campaign is designed to encourage girls around the world to get interested and involved with STEM. “We continue our mission by encouraging and empowering girls at outreaches, competitions, events, and online,” says Lexi.</p>\n<p>At the 2022 <em>FIRST</em> Championship held in Houston, Texas, Lexi and the Exploding Bacon team saw firsthand the impact #FIRSTLikeAGirl has had.</p>\n<p>“One of our ambassador teams who had been really inspired and encouraged by our program came up to us during lunch to talk,” she recalls. “They began telling us about the immense impact our program had on their team, and they gave us a book. The book was about all sorts of prominent girls and women in STEM throughout history. On the first blank page, all the girls from their team had signed the book and each wrote us a message about how much our program has meant to them.”</p>\n<p>Lexi and her team work hard to inspire future scientists and engineers because they believe a better future can only be accomplished by working together.</p>\n<p>“For me, building the future means creating a path for myself and others that allows people to work together to make a kinder society, but also a more advanced one,” she says. “When I say advanced, I mean stronger, affordable, safer, and more reliable technology and products in all industries…I believe the only way to get there is by working with others of all different backgrounds and skill sets.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186773]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187244\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts.jpg\" alt=\"The CocoNuts team from Star Wars: Force for Change and FIRST's Build the Future.\" width=\"1266\" height=\"843\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts.jpg 1266w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts-150x100.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts-300x200.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts-768x511.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/build-the-future-coconuts-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>CocoNuts</strong></p>\n<p>Hannah Gurne and her team are also working with the next generation to create a brighter future. The CocoNuts of Flagstaff, Arizona, focus their efforts on their local community.</p>\n<p>“The citizens of Flagstaff, especially our school community, are an eclectic blend of people with the primary populations being white, indigenous, and Hispanic/Latinx,” Hannah tells StarWars.com. “As a team we strive to represent this demographic makeup in two main ways: by being role models and [by] enabling the next generation to continue the team’s mission of making STEM education accessible.”</p>\n<p>Members of the team are invited to focus their energy on efforts that mean something to them personally. One senior member hosted a free STEM diversity fair at the CocoNuts school. “He entitled the event ‘También Los Puedes Hacer,’ signifying that there shouldn’t be boundaries when engaging with STEM, and that ‘I Can Do It Too,’” says Hannah.</p>\n<p>Another teammate focused on the Diné (formerly known as the Navajo) Reservation. “She thought about her cousins that live three hours away on the Diné Reservation, and their limited access to STEM focused groups,” Hannah recalls. “She worked alongside her family and their school to create a <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>FIRST</em>® Tech Challenge team</a>.”</p>\n<p>During the pandemic, Hannah and her team continued to work with indigenous communities through virtual <em>FIRST</em> robotics workshops and online mentoring. “Some of these virtual trainings included teaching coding and what the various sensors are used for,” she says. “Seeing these young students get excited to build their own robot even through a screen was inspiring.”</p>\n<p>Like Seth and Lexi, Hannah has found encouragement in the <em>Star Wars </em>galaxy.</p>\n<p>“<em>Star Wars</em> has given us the words that have encapsulated an immeasurable amount of passion and drive,” she says. “[In 2019] the team was privileged to be invited to the Arizona Senate…In our speech, we explained our outreach methods, and how we continued to inspire hope, and finished our presentation with Princess Leia’s famous quote, ‘What is it they’ve sent us?’ ‘Hope.’</p>\n<p>“What we originally added as an inside joke to our nerdiness and love of <em>Star Wars</em> was quickly realized by the team as true to our mission and message. As time has passed the last few years, the CocoNuts adopted the quote and began to morph it into our own. At the end of the day, we proudly proclaim, ‘We are the CocoNuts, and we are the Hope for the Future!’”</p>\n<p><em>Visit the </em><a href=\"https://community.firstinspires.org/topic/build-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FIRST <em>Community Blog</em></a><em> to read more Build the Future team stories.</em></p>\n<div><div class=\"dplus-promo-container\"><a class=\"dplus-promo-image-anchor\" href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle?cid=DTCI-Synergy-StarWars-Blog-Acquisition-Bundle-US-Bundle-DisneyPlus-EN-BlogWidget-StarWars_BlogWidget_GetTheDisneyBundle-NA\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"1001\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disneyplus-bundle-lockup-1000x215.png\" class=\"attachment-disney-plus-promo size-disney-plus-promo\" alt=\"Hulu.

What chance is involved? What fate, what luck? So from the very beginning of this I was interested in learning what brought these people to this work. What were the relationships that they made when they arrived? Why did they continue to work there much longer than they expected, some for forty-five years or more? What has all that meant to these amazing advancements in technology? It’s about people, and their gifts, and out of those gifts came technological advancements that boggle the mind.”</p>\n<p>The executive producers for <em>Light &amp; Magic</em> are Howard, Grazer and Justin Wilkes from Imagine Documentaries, Kasdan, and Lucasfilm’s Kathleen Kennedy and Michelle Rejwan.</p>\n<p>Jacqui Lopez and Michael Garcia serve as co-executive producers, and the series is executive produced by Marc Gilbar and Meredith Kaulfers. The series producer is Christopher St. John and Nicole Pusateri is the supervising producer.</p>\n<p>Kasdan and the producers assembled a talented roster of filmmakers for the project, including cinematographers Nicola b Marsh and Emily Topper, and editors Jonah Moran, Anoosh Tertzakian and Mike Long. The music is by James Newton Howard.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><iframe width=\"660\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DM_XwzOK_98?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Light &#038; Magic | Official Trailer | Disney+\"></iframe></p>\n</div>\n<p>The six-part documentary series premieres today, July 27, exclusively on Disney+.</p>\n<div><div class=\"dplus-promo-container\"><a class=\"dplus-promo-image-anchor\" href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle?cid=DTCI-Synergy-StarWars-Blog-Acquisition-Bundle-US-Bundle-DisneyPlus-EN-BlogWidget-StarWars_BlogWidget_GetTheDisneyBundle-NA\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"1001\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disneyplus-bundle-lockup-1000x215.png\" class=\"attachment-disney-plus-promo size-disney-plus-promo\" alt=\"Hulu.

Beru was kindhearted, and her thoughtfulness disguised her grit and determination. She dreamed of opening her own café in her hometown. (What would be Beru’s specialty? Blue-milk cheese, of course.)

      "rendered": "<p>If the Jedi say that attachments are forbidden, then perhaps it’s against the Jedi Code to get a tattoo. Thankfully, in this case, I’m no Jedi. So, I sat down with seven-time licensed Lucasfilm tattoo artist, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mikebiancoart/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Bianco</a>, to get my very own <em>Star Wars</em> tattoo during <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/star-wars-celebration\"><em>Star Wars</em> Celebration Anaheim 2022</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Star Wars</em> has had a huge influence in my life. I grew up watching the prequel trilogy with <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em> as my favorite movie. They had a pivotal role in my upbringing and I wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for the part that this galaxy far, far away played in my childhood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186542]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-186557\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Bianco working on the japor snippet tattoo\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo-150x113.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo-768x576.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-mike-bianco-tattoo-shottwo-1088x816.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once I decided that I wanted to get a <em>Star Wars </em>tattoo at Celebration, I pitched the idea to StarWars.com as a possible video segment or article. Somehow, they went for both. There was no turning back.</p>\n<p>We began the design process a few weeks before the appointment so we could get an idea of what we would be filming for the <em>Star Wars</em> <em>Celebration LIVE!</em> show. When Mike and I started designing my tattoo, I had no idea what I wanted to get. The <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy is vast and overwhelming with tattoo options. This would not be my first <em>Star Wars</em> related tattoo &#8212; I have a beat-up X-wing helmet and a cute little bug with the Rebel Alliance insignia on it &#8212; but I wanted to break away from some of the more obvious symbols and try for something that was subtle. What could be just subtle enough for fans to really have to examine in order to understand its meaning?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186542]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168873\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet.jpg\" alt=\"A necklace made from a japor snippet, in Padmé's hands.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet-150x65.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet-300x129.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet-768x331.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japor-snippet-1024x441.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I wanted a tattoo that reflected my love of the prequels, but also tied into the rest of the Skywalker Saga. That’s easier than it sounds. I sent Mike an email with a vague description, saying, “I want something that celebrates the prequels and <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/padme-amidala\">Padmé Amidala</a>, but I do not want to get a portrait.” With limited options, Mike had to stew on my request while I was also trying to figure out what I want.</p>\n<p>As if predestined by the Force, we arrived at the same idea, kind of at the same time: the japor snippet that Anakin gives to Padmé. Mike also suggested depicting it wrapped in the flowers that were in Padmé’s hair during her funeral. He responded with this idea at the same time the japor snippet popped into my head. Wizard!</p>\n<p>The japor snippet dawned on me because of how simple yet significant it is. <em>The Phantom Menace</em> was the first <em>Star Wars</em> film I saw in theaters. I was obsessed with everything about it. To me, the japor snippet is a perfect reflection of the impact <em>The Phantom Menace</em> had on me as a kid. And as a tattoo it would be subtle enough from afar, but jam-packed with meaning.</p><section>\n\t\t<div id=\"native-ad-tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">TM.Ads.addNativeAd( \"native-ad-tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" , \"tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" );</script>\n\t</section>\n<p>It&#8217;s a thread that pulls the prequels together and signifies the start of a journey in the Skywalker Saga. It’s Anakin’s journey after leaving everything behind to become a Jedi and it’s Padmé’s journey of holding on to hope while believing in the future of the Republic. Although it ends in tragedy, the japor snippet signifies what <em>Star Wars</em> is about: family, hope, and the choice to be better. From this gift Anakin gives Padmé, a hope for a better future is born. It’s also a good luck charm, and a symbol of their love.</p>\n<p>Of course, the highlight of this experience was getting the tattoo on camera for <em>Star Wars</em> <em>Celebration LIVE!</em>. A tattoo segment is something of a tradition for StarWars.com’s live coverage of Celebration, and I’m truly grateful to be the subject this year. Not only was I able to get a permanent reminder of how much this saga means to me, I also got to do it while working with some of the most talented people in the business. You can watch the segment below.</p>\n<p>The actual tattoo process was a breeze. I’ve been collecting tattoos like Grievous collects lightsabers for the past eight years, so I was familiar with the process and time it takes to get a tattoo of this detail. Most of my tattoos are black and white with shading, and this design followed that same pattern. The total process was about two hours, but it flew by as I was talking to Mike and the production crew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186542]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-186559\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo.jpg\" alt=\"Japor snippet tattoo by Mike Bianco\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo-150x113.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo-768x576.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-finished-tattoo-1088x816.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Depending on the tattoo experience, people either hate the line work the most or they hate the shading part the most. Outlining the tattoo usually puts me to sleep, but it’s the shading part afterwards that has me wanting to go home and rethink my life. I got to watch as Mike worked on my tattoo and, even with the uncomfortable shading, I was blown away by the detail and care  that he put into this design to bring it to life.</p>\n<p>When I saw the finished piece, I felt like it was always part of me. It was meant to be there. I imagined my younger self watching me get this tattoo for <em>Star Wars</em> <em>Celebration LIVE!</em>. I got this tattoo for her.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186542]\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-186558 size-full\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2.jpg\" alt=\"Japor snippet tattoo by Mike Bianco healed\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2-150x113.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/swc-tattoo-healed-tattoo-tightshot-2-1088x816.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I’m so honored that I got to be part of the tattoo tradition with <em>Star Wars Celebration LIVE!</em> and talk about why I love the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels so dearly. These films were my first step into a larger galaxy, and getting a tattoo that represented that during <em>Star Wars</em> Celebration and the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of<em> Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</em> is an experience I’ll treasure, even after I’m a Force ghost.</p>\n<p>The final result of Mike’s design is absolutely beautiful, and I’m so excited that I get to have a little good luck charm with me wherever I go. And I’m already thinking about my next <em>Star Wars </em>tattoo.

Although no longer manufactured, Elliott purchased a Master Replicas thermal detonator for the exterior, then got to work dismantling it. “We rewired the electronics in our shop to behave the way [showrunner and director] Deborah Chow wanted it to work in the scene,” he says. “It was far more efficient to use the actual merchandise, than to resculpt, remold, and repaint something new.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187018]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187539\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice.jpg\" alt=\"Spice containers\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice-150x84.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice-300x169.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice-768x432.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-spice-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Less of a departure are the spice canisters found on the bustling world of Daiyu.

Beyond the size difference of the two actors, “it had to both hold Leia&#8217;s droid as well as the blaster we designed for Tala.” To complete the effect, Tala&#8217;s holster was designed as a drop holster. “For Leia, we took the drop portion off of the gun belt and it just so happened to fit her nearly perfectly.” A Han Solo-style scope on Tala’s blaster helped to fill the width needed to later accommodate the round droid L0-LA59. “It was a super tricky puzzle to solve, but so satisfying when it actually worked,” Elliott says.</p>\n<p><strong>Used-future</strong></p>\n<p>Other props called for a return to the grittiness that has made the <em>Star Wars</em> aesthetic unique among other sci-fi and fantasy stories.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187018]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187541\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key.jpg\" alt=\"Launch key\" width=\"1500\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key.jpg 1500w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key-150x42.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key-300x84.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key-768x216.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/owk-props2-launch-key-1024x288.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The launch key for the cargo transport shuttle forced prop makers to consider the needs of the story versus simply finding something that fit into Leia’s small hand. “The ship is an automated transport in the script, so there was little logic in having a launch key designed for a human,” Elliott says. “Instead, we went with a rigged scomp [link] computer interface device that had its own circuit board. This is to simulate what an astromech would use to start the launch sequence and program the route.”</p>\n<p><em>For a closer look at these and other props from the</em> <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/series/obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> <em>limited series, check out the latest episode of </em>This Week!

The scribe took his first steps with 2016’s <em>Lando</em>, a five-issue miniseries that garnered significant acclaim. From there, Soule’s <em>Star Wars</em> star continued to rise, as he racked up credits including <em>Poe Dameron</em>, <em>The Rise of Kylo Ren</em>, <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em>, and more, often with major contributions to lore; when it came time to shape what would become the <em>Star Wars: The High Republic </em>initiative, Soule was one of five writers recruited as an architect of its first stories. Today, Soule is at the helm of Marvel’s flagship <em>Star Wars </em>series, which is celebrating a milestone along with its writer: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-2020-Charles-Soule-ebook/dp/B09V3M59KB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZGXN5GXGJQCE&amp;keywords=star+wars+25&amp;qid=1657229380&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=star+wars+25%2Cdigital-text%2C164&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Star Wars</em> #25</a>, now available, is Soule’s 100<sup>th</sup> <em>Star Wars </em>comic. And it’s no ordinary issue. The comic includes four short stories that all see Soule return to characters from his prior runs &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/anakin-skywalker\">Anakin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/anakin-skywalker\">Darth Vader</a> and <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious\">Palpatine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/kylo-ren\">Kylo Ren</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/poe-dameron\">Poe Dameron</a> &#8212; while reuniting with the artists from each respective title. To mark the occasion, StarWars.com spoke with Soule about hitting the 100-issue mark, why Ben Solo bleeding his kyber crystal was so important, and why two stories from <em>Star Wars </em>#25 will be particularly “resonant.”</p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: To start, I want to say congratulations on the milestone. That&#8217;s pretty amazing. What does it mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> When all of this occurred to me, it was really just late last year, probably. I was just, “I wonder how many of these things I&#8217;ve written,” and I just started adding it up because it was something that you do to procrastinate from doing the actual work of writing the issues. I realized how close I was to writing a hundred. Like, I was very, very close. I think, when I ran the numbers, it was like 97 or something like that. And so I was like, “Man, that&#8217;s crazy.” And then I did some more procrastination slash research slash analysis, and looked to see what some of the other prominent <em>Star Wars</em> comic book writers had done. And I realized that, at least in the modern canon, no one else had gotten there.</p>\n<p>It meant to me that I had kind of definitively done what I always wanted to do in <em>Star Wars</em>, which was to make a mark, contribute in some significant way to this thing that I&#8217;d loved since I was really little. And you don&#8217;t have to write a hundred comics to do that. You can do that with one story. You can do that by being a fan. You can do that by loving <em>Star Wars</em>, however you want to love it. You don&#8217;t have to do this thing. But for me, it just felt like a really solid, real milestone that made me feel really good. I mean, that&#8217;s thousands of pages of material, thousands of pages of story that I got to create with some of the best artists in all of comics, and told stories that resonated with the fans, and have really given me the <em>Star Wars</em> career I have today, which is significant and goes beyond comics.</p>\n<p>So it felt great, I guess, which is what I could have said very quickly [<em>Laughs.</em>] as opposed to going through that long spiel. Certain things happen in your career that bring things home for you in a way, right? That make it clear to you where you are or what you&#8217;ve achieved, or maybe how your work is received, that pull you out of the day to day, constant applied effort of making the stuff. And for me, this really was one of those, realizing that I had done or was about to do 100 of them.</p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: What would you say you&#8217;ve learned when it comes to writing <em>Star Wars</em> that you might not have known when you started?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> Honestly, I think writing <em>Star Wars</em> is like playing an instrument, and I use that metaphor a lot when applying it to just different things that you have to have a constant, sort of, applied effort. I&#8217;ve used that phrase twice in this interview, but like, it&#8217;s about practice and working hard and incremental improvement. And so every story you tell is both a story in and of itself, but it&#8217;s also a stepping stone to the next story you&#8217;re going to tell. I think there are a lot of things about writing <em>Star Wars</em> as well that you don&#8217;t get on project one. You have to figure out how to dance between the raindrops in the way that so much of the story has kind of already been told, and you&#8217;re working within an established history. You can&#8217;t tell the story of the death of Luke Skywalker, because we know the story of the death of Luke Skywalker, for example. It&#8217;s a very particular muscle to be able to tell stories that matter in and among all the other stories that matter, with characters for whom we&#8217;ve seen many of the most significant events in their lives &#8212; their birth to their death, in many cases. So, figuring out how to do that, that feels like a very <em>Star Wars</em>y muscle in particular. Like, telling good <em>Star Wars</em> stories within the existing Skywalker Saga stuff.</p>\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s been very informative in terms of working within a larger shared universe that keeps a consistent history, because there&#8217;s a lot of what you&#8217;d call “stakeholders,” right? Lucasfilm Story Group has a very significant role in making sure that the stories that are told work within the larger stories of the galaxy. I would say the fans are stakeholders in a pretty significant way. Like, you&#8217;re telling stories for a group of fans who love this thing as much as you do. And then of course, there&#8217;s Marvel too, right? Because when you write comics for <em>Star Wars</em>, you&#8217;re working with incredible people at Marvel, but you&#8217;re also working with incredible people at Lucasfilm. And you&#8217;re also working directly with an artist, and a colorist, and a letterer, and the creative team. And you&#8217;re also kind of working with yourself and your own relationship with <em>Star Wars</em>. So that&#8217;s a lot to navigate. It gives you some very valuable skills in terms of doing this particular job, but also jobs like it that might exist out in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: I&#8217;d like to go through what I think are some of like the bigger moments in some of your comics, and I&#8217;ll just say what they are, and you can just kind of share memories of coming up with the idea, pitching them to Lucasfilm, anything you want to talk about.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> Sure, sure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187110\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Lando 3 cover\" width=\"750\" height=\"1139\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover.jpg 750w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover-198x300.jpg 198w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-cover-674x1024.jpg 674w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: First, the introduction of Momin’s mask. <em>Lando</em> #3.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> There’s a Sith Lord, basically, in <em>Star Wars</em>, who has a long running backstory through several different projects that I&#8217;ve worked on. He popped up in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> project I ever did, which was <em>Lando</em>, my series with Alex Maleev and Paul Mounts. And then he&#8217;s referenced other places; He has a very significant role in the <em>Darth Vader</em> series I did with Giuseppe Camuncoli and David Curiel. But I didn&#8217;t know when I introduced Momin that he was going to be the person who designed Darth Vader’s castle. When I introduced Momin, Darth Vader&#8217;s castle did not exist, except on like a [piece of] concept or at the Lucasfilm archives, you know?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187111\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Lando 3 page 1 and 2\" width=\"1280\" height=\"989\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2-150x116.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2-300x232.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2-768x593.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-1-2-1024x791.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-3.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187112\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-3.jpg\" alt=\"Lando 3 page 3\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-3.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-3-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-lando-Pages-3-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p>So when I introduced Momin, that was in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> series that I ever did, which was the <em>Lando</em> miniseries. I had no idea if I was ever going to be able to tell anymore <em>Star Wars</em> stuff. So when I did that, I was like, “I&#8217;m going to tell the coolest things I can think of, because this might be my only chance to ever do it.” One of those things was a spooky, possessed mask of a Sith Lord that could do some crazy stuff. The extent of the crazy stuff it ended up being able to do, I didn&#8217;t know that day, but I knew it felt cool. And I knew that I would dig it as a fan and other fans could hopefully dig it too. And, you know, I had no idea how significant that character was going to become to me, or for many fans, but I&#8217;m glad it did.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187114\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-cover.jpg\" alt=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 1 cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-cover.jpg 650w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-cover-98x150.jpg 98w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-cover-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: Okay, next, the return of <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/qi-ra\">Qi’ra</a>. <em>War of the Bounty Hunters </em>#1.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> This was a great one. I had the <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em> idea as part of my original pitch document for the <em>Star Wars</em> series, the flagship Marvel <em>Star Wars</em> series, when I knew I was going to be taking it over. Because I wanted to build to a crossover that was going to hit right around when <em>War of the Bounty Hunters </em>hits in the series, which is like issue 13 or something like that. And I knew that Boba Fett was going to lose the carbonite-frozen Han solo, and everybody was going to fight over him, and all the different bounty hunters were going to go after him because, you know, he had all these different elements &#8212; criminal elements, and the rebels, and even the Imperials, who wanted Solo. So it seemed like you had a great McGuffin, or an engine for a story there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-qi-ra.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187115\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-qi-ra.jpg\" alt=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 1 Qi'ra's entrance\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-qi-ra.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-qi-ra-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-bounty-hunters-qi-ra-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p>There was a creative summit at the Marvel offices back &#8212; I&#8217;m going to say it was in 2019, maybe something like that. It was before the pandemic, certainly, when we were all talking about the idea. And I was like, “You know who would be the best person to have stolen Han is Qi’ra”. And so we started talking about the idea live in the room. [Lucasfilm’s] Matt Martin was there, [Lucasfilm Publishing creative director] and Mike Siglain was there, and a number of other Lucasfilm folks were there along with folks from Marvel, [editor] Mark Paniccia and so on. It just started to feel really good in the way that ideas sometimes do. And I wouldn&#8217;t say it was undeniable at that point. Qi’ra was a character that had not appeared any place else other than, I think, a short story here or there. Like, very, very minor appearances since the <em>Solo</em> film.</p>\n<p>I thought, I think a lot of people at Lucasfilm thought, that there was a lot of meat on the bone there as far as that character. We all started talking it through in the room. I didn&#8217;t have it when I first came up with <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em>. It was something that just organically evolved out of the process of thinking about and talking through that story, but I&#8217;m so glad it did. I think the reaction to Qi’ra&#8217;s return was phenomenal. People were so excited. I was so excited. And the things that we&#8217;ve been able to do with her since then, I think it&#8217;s awesome. She&#8217;s all over this period of <em>Star Wars</em> now, set between Episode V and Episode VI. And to me, anyway, it doesn&#8217;t feel forced. It feels like she&#8217;s doing the things that she was set up to do back in the <em>Solo</em> film. You know, this feels like a very good culmination of her story, at least this chapter of it. So it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-darth-vader-25-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187120\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-darth-vader-25-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Darth Vader 25 cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-darth-vader-25-cover.jpg 650w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-darth-vader-25-cover-98x150.jpg 98w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-darth-vader-25-cover-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: Next, Vader&#8217;s vision, which is essentially all of <em>Darth Vader</em> #25.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> Yeah. This one I did have more clearly set up from the beginning. One of the things that was kind of fun about the <em>Vader</em> book was that I was told the project was a 25-issue project, just like Kieron Gillen’s run before mine. So I knew that I had a chunk of time that I could use to accomplish the goal that I had set for myself with that series, which is that “no to yes” thing I&#8217;ve talked about in other interviews. Vader goes from, “No, I will not accept this new reality that I&#8217;m in. I don&#8217;t believe you that my wife can&#8217;t be returned to me, all these things. I&#8217;m going to fight, fight, fight,” do everything Vader does. And then at the end of the series, his last word is “yes.” He&#8217;s accepted that this is who he is now. To bring up something that just appeared in the <em>Obi-Wan </em><em>Kenobi </em>show, he has killed Anakin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187251\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-1.jpg\" alt=\"Darth Vader revisits his past in a vision in Darth Vader #25.\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-1.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-1-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-1-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-2.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187250\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-2.jpg\" alt=\"Darth Vader revisits his past in a vision in Darth Vader #25.\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-2.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-2-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/darth-vader-25-page-2-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You have that happening over the course of the series in a lot of different ways. The sort of slow murder that he does of Anakin Skywalker and, in the end, I knew that he needed to confront himself in a way that was very direct. Vader doesn&#8217;t have an internal monologue because, for me anyway, the way I was writing that series, I didn&#8217;t want to have caption boxes with like, “This is what Vader&#8217;s thinking about at this particular moment.” It’s better if you&#8217;re always a little removed from him. There&#8217;s a reason Vader wears a mask. This was a way for him to go into direct dialogue with the next version of himself, right? It was the dark side giving him the opportunity to really let go of his past, to see what was ahead for him, to come to terms with the fact that Padmé was gone forever. Like, the thing that he had become was not something that Padmé would even want anymore.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, these big issues, the ones that people talk about later &#8212; like, <em>Vader</em> 18&#8217;s another one, <em>Star Wars </em>18’s another one &#8212; they just sort of happen. I just start and then I just go and it works. I do remember there was an element in the original script for <em>Darth Vader</em> 25 &#8212; there were all these quotes, like Vader is hearing words throughout the issue. They were lines from, basically, <em>Star Wars</em> films, and other media that had been repurposed. Like, at one point he hears “Let the past die, kill it if you have to,” he hears “I am your father,” he hears these lines. And the original version of that was for those to appear integrated into the backgrounds of the art, like a mountain side might have the words carved into it, that kind of thing. And we kicked it around, Giuseppe Camuncoli and myself, trying to find a way that it would work without getting in the way of the things that Vader actually needed to physically do in the panels. And we couldn&#8217;t quite get there. So we used caption boxes, which look amazing, I think the issue came out perfectly well, but that&#8217;s one of those ideas that, you know, it evolved throughout the course of the production of that issue. But I remember we all spent a lot of time on it and we all knew how important it was. I think the results on that really speak for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the prequels and that issue, and your run as a whole, seemed to really embrace them. Was that on your mind at all as you were writing it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> I like all of <em>Star Wars</em>. There is not a <em>Star Wars</em> thing that I don&#8217;t like and, you know, sometimes you have to say, or I have to be like, “Okay, well, there&#8217;s some things that are some creative choices here that maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have made if I was doing this,” but there&#8217;s also all this amazing stuff that is incredible. And the prequels are a great example of that. You can single out certain elements of them that kind of make them of their time or make them idiosyncratic, because they&#8217;re expressing certain creators’ views or whatever was going on when those were being made. But they&#8217;re still awesome. They&#8217;re super, super cool. And more importantly, they happened, and whether it&#8217;s the way you would&#8217;ve done it or the way you wanted to see it, the minute you start treating every piece of <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling as part of the history, then it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you liked it or not. It happened. There are elements of real-world history I don&#8217;t particularly like, but they happened. And so when you&#8217;re telling a story, you have to incorporate those things, and through the lens of history we look at certain events differently. We look at the way things happen with the lens of hindsight in a different way. And I always thought there was a lot of cool stuff to be taken from the journey of Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader. And because the <em>Vader</em> series was directly connected to that, I was able to just pick the elements that I liked and build new stories from them, which is what I think good <em>Star Wars</em> storytellers do. I think we saw a lot of the same stuff in <em>Obi-Wan </em><em>Kenobi</em>. There’s a reason that all of that landed as well as it did, whether you&#8217;re talking about the <em>Vader</em> series or <em>Obi-Wan </em><em>Kenobi</em>. And it&#8217;s because the core story of the prequels is amazing. It&#8217;s this beautiful, epic tragedy. It&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187122\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 4 cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-cover.jpg 650w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-cover-98x150.jpg 98w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-cover-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-kyber.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187123\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-kyber.jpg\" alt=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 4 with the kyber crystal\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-kyber.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-kyber-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-rise-of-kylo-ren-4-kyber-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: Kylo Ren bleeding his kyber crystal. <em>Rise of Kylo Ren</em> #4.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> Yeah, that was a big one too. Four issues is not a huge amount of time to tell a story like that. I think <em>Rise of Kylo Ren</em>, Will [Sliney] and I could have made that series go on longer, for sure, and just flesh out some of the stuff. I think I pitched an issue between three and four, like more of the newly-minted Ben Solo Knight of Ren going around with them for a little bit. And ultimately, because of publishing schedules and various reasons, we stuck with four. There&#8217;s a version of doing this job when you have all this space in the world, you have an infinite page count, like on a creator-owned series or something like that. And then there&#8217;s when you&#8217;re working in licensed properties or properties that have to hit their deadlines, and so the artists have to get the work done, and you have 20 pages and that is it. And you become very economical about trying to figure out the moments that will get the story across with the smallest amount of page count. And you choose moments that are very evocative for the reader. So like, one panel can provide you the mental equivalent of like 20 pages of storytelling. But there are some beats, even in a short series that you cannot stint on. You can&#8217;t ignore them. They&#8217;re too big. They need the space. And there are a lot of elements, particularly in <em>Kylo Ren</em> 4, that needed to be there. And him really, really becoming the person that he becomes &#8212; Ben Solo really lets go of Ben Solo and becomes Kylo Ren in that issue [is one of them]. To me, there wasn&#8217;t much of a better idea to do that than through the metaphor of him bleeding his crystal. Because when you take a kyber crystal and you make it red, what&#8217;s actually happening is you are pouring all of your own pain and anger and fear into it. And then like, the living Force energy of the kyber crystal, its frequency changes. It&#8217;s corrupted, almost. Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it. I&#8217;m going to say it was corrupted. It&#8217;s so traumatized by all of that anger and pain and fear and rage that it literally turns from whatever color it originally is &#8212; blue, in Ben&#8217;s case &#8212; to red.</p>\n<p>The whole series, up to that point, was giving you all the reasons for Ben&#8217;s rage and pain and fear. You saw, on the page, all the things he was angry about, all the things he was afraid of, all the reasons he had all of this inside him. And then it was a very visceral way to dump all of that out, to externalize all of that and put it someplace &#8212; into the weapon that he&#8217;s then going to use to fight and murder and kill and do all the terrible things Kylo Ren does. So, I knew that bit had to be there. There were some other parts I considered, like I considered stuff with the mask. I considered stuff with other things that Kylo Ren could possibly have done. But to me, bleeding the crystal was the one that was going to get the most kind of character bang for your buck. And Will drew the hell out of it. I think it worked really well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187125\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Wars of the Bounty Hunters 3 cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-cover.jpg 650w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-cover-98x150.jpg 98w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-cover-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-chewbacca.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187124\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-chewbacca.jpg\" alt=\"Wars of the Bounty Hunters 3 Lando and Chewbacca\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-chewbacca.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-chewbacca-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-wars-of-the-bounty-hunters-3-chewbacca-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: And finally, “Beat his ass, Chewbacca,” from <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em> #3.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> [<em>Laughs.</em>] There&#8217;s a reason I write <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/lando-calrissian\">Lando Calrissian</a> as much as I do. He was the first character I ever wrote in <em>Star Wars</em>. I think Lando is just spectacular. The way that he stands out is utterly unique in <em>Star Wars</em> to me. Billy Dee Williams, Donald Glover, the, the many, many, many print and comics [appearances], he is always super, super cool. And in <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em>, I had this opportunity to feature him and Chewbacca in a way that I hadn&#8217;t really &#8212; I mean, I kind of had written stuff like that, but when you see them in <em>War of the Bounty Hunters</em>, which is set after <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> when nobody really trusts Lando and he has betrayed the rebels, he&#8217;s building his reputation up a little bit.</p>\n<p>I think you need these moments where you&#8217;re like, “Oh yeah, Lando is awesome.” I don&#8217;t know, I was sure they would say no to that line. “Beat his ass, Chewbacca,” I mean, it&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s what Lando Calrissian would say. It doesn’t necessarily mean I was sure it would fly in a <em>Star Wars</em> comic published by Marvel in 2021. But they saw the possibilities in “Beat his ass, Chewbacca,” and now it is permanently enshrined in <em>Star Wars</em> canon, and I see it pretty often on Twitter as a little meme, which makes me happy. It does feel like, yeah, you could write Kylo Ren bleeding his crystal, you can write Darth Vader seeing a vision of Padmé, whatever, like, these deep [sequences]. But <em>Star Wars</em> works because it&#8217;s not just that stuff. It&#8217;s also sometimes “Beat his ass, Chewbacca.” And being able to make a moment with, hell, Obi-Wan and Anakin, and having, a deep, heartfelt conversation work, and also having an opportunity to make “Beat his ass, Chewbacca,” work &#8212; that&#8217;s a career I can be proud of in <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-cover.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187126\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars 25 cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-cover.jpg 650w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-cover-98x150.jpg 98w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-cover-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: I got to read <em>Star Wars </em>#25, your 100<sup>th</sup> issue. I really enjoyed the format of it and that you got to revisit some of the characters and series from your past. What was that experience like for you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> I had the idea, which this is often the case with these things. Like, “That&#8217;s going to be so cool.” And then, you know, at some point down the road, I&#8217;m like, “Oh man, now I actually have to do it.” And the thing that I have to do has to live up to being as cool as the version that I saw in my head when I had the idea and pitched it in the first place. <em>Star Wars</em> 25 is a perfect, perfect example of that, because my pitch was, “Hey, this is my 100th script. I should do something really cool.” And the coolest thing I could think of would be to revisit some of the notable series that I did and some of the notable characters that I&#8217;ve worked on with those creative teams. Let&#8217;s get the band back together and do all these things.After some approvals and some [conversation around], “Wow, can we really juggle all the balls that need to be juggled here to make this work,” it looked like it would. And so then it&#8217;s like, “Okay, I&#8217;m going to write a new Darth Vader story with Giuseppe Camuncoli as a little extra.” If you&#8217;re going to talk about like, the jewels in my <em>Star Wars</em> crown, that <em>Darth Vader</em> series is one of them, I think, for sure. And the idea that I&#8217;m going to add a little bit to it and maybe ruin it, you know, who knows? Those thoughts were definitely going through my mind when I was working on all of these things, but it&#8217;s just like anything else. You sit down with the notebook and you start thinking, “Okay, what are the moments I want to see?” Like, what are the things that the fans are going to want to see? What are the beats that would be interesting?</p>\n<p>And then you start thinking, what would be the stories that would use the skill sets of the artists the best? What would be the neatest juxtaposition, when now you have a story with four stories within it, and that should have some sort of a narrative too, right? Because the issue begins with the Obi-Wan and Anakin story. Then you get the Vader story, then you get the Kylo Ren story, and then you get the Poe story. And there&#8217;s a reason those go in that order, which I think, hopefully, will be apparent when you read it.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to tell this story with one artist drawing all of it. And I think it&#8217;s very meaningful to me that as many people came back as they did, whether it was Will Sliney drawing the Kylo story or Steve McNiven doing that incredible cover that he did. When the people that you worked with who are incredibly successful, incredibly busy, are willing to adjust their schedule to come back and work with you again, to tell a story together again, to celebrate the work you did before, it feels good beyond just the creative element. It feels like you did a good job, not just with the stories before, but with the relationship you made with those artists and those teams. This is a very feel-good project for me. No doubt about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-coruscant-excerpt.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[187104]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187127\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-coruscant-excerpt.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars 25 Obi-Wan and Anakin story\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-coruscant-excerpt.jpg 659w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-coruscant-excerpt-99x150.jpg 99w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charles-soule-interview-star-wars-25-coruscant-excerpt-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything from it, but I would say that my favorite story was “The Lesson,” which is really kind of divided into two parts. It follows two sparring matches, one between Obi-Wan and Anakin, and one between Palpatine and Vader. It felt really timely and emotional considering what we saw in the <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> show. Could you talk about coming up with the framework for those stories, and then what you felt watching <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, knowing that this issue was coming out?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> “The Lesson” is the title for both of the first two stories in the volume. This is a little spoilery, but they&#8217;re both built around the idea of a lightsaber lesson, and the first one is Obi-Wan and Anakin, which is set between Episode I and II. So you have Anakin having a sparring lesson with Obi-Wan, which is kind of like what we saw at the beginning of episode three of the <em>Obi-Wan </em><em>Kenobi</em> show. Obviously, Anakin&#8217;s much younger here, but it&#8217;s there. And then in the Vader story, which is also titled “The Lesson,” you have a lesson between Palpatine and Vader, and also built around the idea of lightsaber sparring and the way that you fight.</p>\n<p>For me, being able to juxtapose Anakin and Vader so directly, and also Obi-Wan and Palpatine as, really, Vader slash Anakin&#8217;s two masters &#8212; the primary teachers who taught him to be who he was &#8212; that seemed like an opportunity that was too good to pass up, creatively. And then seeing how the <em>Obi-Wan </em><em>Kenobi</em> show &#8212; like, when I first saw that scene at the start of episode three, I was like, “Oh man, did my story get blown outta the water by what was done here?” But it isn’t. All of these stories complement each other in a really good way, I think. And I think that when readers see the way “The Lesson” parts one and two, basically, plays out, I think it&#8217;s just going to feel very much like, resonant, I think, would be the word I would say. I think people will like, it. It feels like the kind of stuff I would dig if I hadn&#8217;t written it. I just can&#8217;t wait for it to come out and have people tell me what they think, as they will.</p>\n<p><strong>StarWars.com: I really enjoyed it. Just one last question. Are you ready for another 100 issues? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Soule:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>.] You know, I&#8217;m coming up on 125 already. There&#8217;s a lot of <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling to come from me, for better or for worse. Obviously, I love telling stories for <em>Star Wars</em> in the comic space. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s given me all the opportunities that I&#8217;ve had so far. It&#8217;s enabled me to connect with so many fans. It&#8217;s built my career into what it is, really, my work in <em>Star Wars</em> comics. So I am absolutely ready to get there.</p>\n<p>I already know what some of those stories are going to be. Like, there&#8217;s some stuff that hasn&#8217;t been announced yet that you guys will be hearing about that will get me closer to that milestone too. I&#8217;m thinking about it and it just makes me excited, because comics is such a vibrant space in <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling. There&#8217;s so much going on. You get to tell so many cool stories that couldn&#8217;t be told other ways. I love it. I would be thrilled if I had the opportunity to go to 200. At this point, I&#8217;m more worried about the one that&#8217;s due next week, though.</p>\n<p>Star Wars <em>#25 is available now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-2020-Charles-Soule-ebook/dp/B09V3M59KB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZGXN5GXGJQCE&amp;keywords=star+wars+25&amp;qid=1657229380&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=star+wars+25%2Cdigital-text%2C164&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in digital on ComiXology</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.comicshoplocator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your local comic shop</a>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div><div class=\"dplus-promo-container\"><a class=\"dplus-promo-image-anchor\" href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle?cid=DTCI-Synergy-StarWars-Blog-Acquisition-Bundle-US-Bundle-DisneyPlus-EN-BlogWidget-StarWars_BlogWidget_GetTheDisneyBundle-NA\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"1001\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disneyplus-bundle-lockup-1000x215.png\" class=\"attachment-disney-plus-promo size-disney-plus-promo\" alt=\"Hulu.

Stay on guard &#8212; you never know when a TIE fighter attack may take place right before your eyes while you’re sipping your favorite libation.</p>\n<p>With a backdrop of spaceports welcoming ships from across the galaxy, bartenders work to create specialty drinks, like a bright red Berken’s Flow reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/mustafar\">Mustafar</a>’s lava, which has a secret reveal when a blacklight is shined on it. The Golden One &#8212; a flavorful, fruity cream-topped drink &#8212; is sweet and creamy, its color reflecting the moons of <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/endor\">Endor</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-wish-hyperspace-lounge-freetown-reserve.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186956]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-186962\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-wish-hyperspace-lounge-freetown-reserve.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Hyperspace lounge's sparkling blue Hyperspace logo on a custom ice cube\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-wish-hyperspace-lounge-freetown-reserve.jpg 750w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-wish-hyperspace-lounge-freetown-reserve-113x150.jpg 113w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disney-wish-hyperspace-lounge-freetown-reserve-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some liquid refreshments are presented with panache, like the Freetown Reserve from <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/tatooine\">Tatooine</a>. Guests can watch as a special infusion tower takes center stage, using local Tatooine botanicals plus added smoke. It’s delicately poured into a glass, the smoky show sure to draw awe-filled glances from across the room.

I went home and drew pictures of all of the characters.&#8221; But as a child, Elliott could never have imagined his affinity for the saga would one day land him a role working behind the scenes on the<a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/series/obi-wan-kenobi\"><em> Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> limited series</a>. As the propmaster for the show, Elliott and his team &#8212; led by Executive Producer and Director Deborah Chow &#8212; helped to bridge the gap between <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, where fans first met Ben Kenobi, and the prequel trilogy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-121331\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan.jpg\" alt=\"Obi-Wan vs. Darth Vader in Star Wars: A New Hope\" width=\"1280\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan-300x127.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan-768x325.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-a-new-hope-obi-wan-1024x433.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>To prepare, Elliott rewatched all the movies that took place before <em>Kenobi</em> in the timeline to gain a deeper understanding of the aesthetic that the show would be evolving from. That helped to reframe Elliott&#8217;s interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/inside-the-lucasfilm-archive-obi-wan-kenobi-props-1\">legacy props like Kenobi&#8217;s lightsaber</a>. &#8220;We used the amazing resources that Pablo Hidalgo brought to the team, and I personally constantly referred to the works of Ralph McQuarrie for inspiration,&#8221; Elliott says. &#8220;I also relied heavily on the same techniques that the prop builders used in <em>A New Hope</em>. We found objects from vintage air pistols to old camera parts, and other pieces from the 1920s through the 1960s; using the same or similar building blocks helped to ensure that the props we made would feel like they belong in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187088\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors.jpg\" alt=\"Thirs Sister, the Grand Inquisitor, and the Fifth Brother\" width=\"1280\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors-150x63.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors-300x126.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors-768x322.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-inquisitors-1024x429.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Animation to live action</strong></p>\n<p>But the production also called for the unique adaptations of several Inquisitor lightsabers, previously realized in animation but never before brought into live action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187427\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Inquisitor and Fifth Brother Inquisitor from Star Wars Rebels\" width=\"1500\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp.jpg 1500w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp-150x49.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp-300x98.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp-768x252.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rebels-inquisitors-comp-1024x336.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/the-grand-inquisitor\">Grand Inquisitor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/fifth-brother-inquisitor\">Fifth Brother</a> made their debut in <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/series/star-wars-rebels\"><em>Star Wars Rebels</em></a>, where we first glimpsed the unique double-bladed lightsabers with circular hilts. With the flick of a button, the circular component could spin like a centrifuge, amping the deadly weapon up to a ferocious speed. In an early meeting with Chow and Dave Filoni, Elliott recalls Filoni&#8217;s advice for translating stylized animation into realistic props: &#8220;Imagine the live-action came first, and that the anmimated material was an exaggerated version of the live action.&#8221; Rather than trying to match the illustrative properties, &#8220;this gave us permission to keep the form factor of the props established in animation, but to control the proportions and to bring them more in line with props made for human hands versus animated ones,&#8221; Elliott says.</p><section>\n\t\t<div id=\"native-ad-tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">TM.Ads.addNativeAd( \"native-ad-tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" , \"tK6v3EMJe7jiRZTFWhFHWHUU\" );</script>\n\t</section>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187096\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1.jpg\" alt=\"Obi-Wan Kenobi's Fifth Brother lightsaber prop\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1-150x84.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fifth-brother-lightsaber-1-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187095\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber.jpg\" alt=\"Obi-Wan Kenobi's Fourth Sister lightsaber prop\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber-150x84.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber-300x169.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber-768x432.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-fourth-sister-lightsaber-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Although the Grand Inquisitor&#8217;s and Fifth Brother&#8217;s lightsaber design is similar, the diameter of all four Inquisitor sabers has shifted to accommodate the actors portraying the roles, including Rupert Friend and Sung Kang respectively, Elliott notes. But that wasn&#8217;t the only change. &#8220;We were careful to minimize the more fragile looking parts of the animated designs, and we took care to make sure that the size of the rings and the diameter of the handles would fit the characters they were intended for.&#8221; The Fifth Brother&#8217;s hilt, for example, is markedly larger than the Fourth Sister&#8217;s, which is a variation on the same theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187090\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber.jpg\" alt=\"Reva fighting Darth Vader\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-150x100.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-300x200.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-768x512.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[186992]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187097\" src=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1.jpg\" alt=\"Obi-Wan Kenobi's Reva's lightsaber prop\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1.jpg 1280w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1-150x84.jpg 150w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/obi-wan-kenobi-props-reva-lightsaber-1-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>The Third Sister</strong></p>\n<p>The hilt created for Reva, the Third Sister, has a striking design that allows her saber to be split in half, configured as the ringed emitter of the standard Inquisitorius is deconstructed into her own unique variation. &#8220;[Lucasfilm VP and executive creative director] Doug Chiang was instrumental in original concepts for the Reva saber,&#8221; Elliott notes. Taking into account Chiang&#8217;s artistic vision and Chow&#8217;s needs in bringing the action sequences with Reva to life, the prop makers built the unique design. &#8220;The functionality of the handle separating into two separate sabers offered a challenge in that the halves didn&#8217;t look right with the circle simply splitting in half,&#8221; Elliott notes. &#8220;We imagined that as the saber splits into two pieces, there would be internal handle extensions to the grip, and retracting guards that pulled in on themselves. Similarly, we had to imagine how the half-circle version that she normally carries, becomes a full circle for when it spins.&#8221; Ultimately, designers decided the semi-circle version would telescope out to create the full circle, a transformation achieved on-screen with help from Industrial Light &amp; Magic visual effects accentuating the practical prop.</p>\n<p><em>For a closer look at these and other props from the</em> <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/series/obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> <em>limited series, check out the latest episode of </em>This Week!
